Rarely updated, limited offline maps

Thanks to https://openfreemap.org/ for providing an easy download of the tiles.
This project removes higher zoom levels to make it more suitable for use on an raspberry pi with
sd-card or if you just don't care to download 85 GB.

Additionally some resources are included for it to be truly usabel offline.
The fonts are not included, the browser will use a fallback font.
